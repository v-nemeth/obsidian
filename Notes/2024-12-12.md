Today I was working from 8 to 15:30 at Centic, where I mainly focused on an editable date on future subscriptions. When I got home I cooked dinner, as Line was out with her friends, and played a lot of Path of Exile and watched some Los Ratones stream. Afterwards I stayed up and looked at a lot of Hiragana while waiting for Line to get home, but when the clock hit 23:30 I went to bed. Line got home at around 1.
