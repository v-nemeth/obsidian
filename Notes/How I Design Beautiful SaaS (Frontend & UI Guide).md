# How I Design Beautiful SaaS (Frontend & UI Guide)

## Principles
### The Zen of Clarity
- "Less is more but make it matter"
### The User is the Muse
- "Design with empathy, not ego"
- "What job does your user hire your product to do?"
- Shift focus from features to **emotions**
- Build a culture of listening (Collect bug reports, make it easy for users)

**Example**
Project management does not need a Gantt chart, it needs to alleviate anxiety of missed deadlines
### The Rhythm of Consistency
- "Designing for muscle memory"
- Do not reinvent the "settings" icon
### The narrative of visual hierarchy
- "Directing the eye, not dictating it"
### Onboard progressively
- "Do not build a tutorial"
### Proof of progress
- Users need to feel like their making progress

### Unfinished actions lingers in memory
- "You've clicked delete, do you really mean this?"
- Do not let the users think, did this actually happen?
