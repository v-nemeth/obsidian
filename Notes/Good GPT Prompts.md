## Lectures to flashcards
I want you to analyze the theory of the lecture(s) I provide. Based on the content, estimate how many exam questions are needed to cover 100% of the material and create exam questions accordingly. Revise the questions to ensure accuracy and alignment with the lecture material. Cover all concepts and subjects mentioned in the slides exhaustively.

Additionally, create a set of flashcards for revision based on the exam questions. Ensure the flashcards are unique, easily understood, and maximize information gain. Each flashcard should be formatted as a concept-definition pair, where the concept and definition are concise (no more than 30 characters each) and easy to remember.
